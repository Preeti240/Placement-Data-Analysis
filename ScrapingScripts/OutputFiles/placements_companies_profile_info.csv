About the Team/Role

Our products provide real-time insights into application performance, user experience, and business outcomes. Complex enterprise applications often contain frustrating blind spots and mysterious, recurring problems. The AppDynamics platform provides real-time visibility into end-to-end application performance from user interface points like browser or mobile-based applications to runtimes on the server side like Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Application Servers and Web Servers, C/C++, Python, NodeJS, leading relational and NoSQL databases as well as network performance between various server runtimes. AppDynamics products monitor very complex cloud-based solutions that process millions of transactions per minute.

Developing these products requires an engineer to design, build and monitor complex distributed systems that processes data to the extent of 1 trillion events per day and 100s of million metrics per minute. This processing of voluminous data translates into 100s of TB of data that we analyze using advanced machine learning techniques to derive useful insights.
 
As an engineer at AppDynamics you would get the opportunity to build highly scalable microservices using cutting edge software like Kafka, Storm, Spark, Hadoop, ElasticSearch, Hbase, NodeJS, cloud environments like AWS, Amazon Dynamo DB, Kinesis, Redis, Graph Database, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and  containers like Docker, mobile platforms like iOS and Android",8.0,202,No,"Software Engineer I

Company overview:
Google is not a conventional company, and we dont intend to become one. True, we share attributes with
the worlds most successful organizations  a focus on innovation and smart business practices comes to
mind  but even as we continue to grow, were committed to retaining a small-company feel. At Google,
we know that every employee has something important to say, and that every employee is integral to our
success. We provide individually-tailored compensation packages that can be comprised of competitive
salary, bonus, and equity components, along with the opportunity to earn further financial bonuses and
rewards. Googlers thrive in small, focused teams and high-energy environments, believe in the ability of
technology to change the world, and are as passionate about their lives as they are about their work. For
more information, visit www.google.com/careers.

The areas:
Engineering & Operations: Google is and always will be an engineering company. We hire people with
a broad set of technical skills who are ready to tackle some of technology's greatest challenges and make
an impact on millions, if not billions, of users. At Google, engineers not only revolutionize search, they
routinely work on massive scalability and storage solutions, large-scale applications and entirely new
platforms for developers around the world. From AdWords to Chrome, Android to YouTube, Social to
Local, Google engineers are changing the world one technological achievement after another.
Engineering Productivity: As a software engineer in the Engineering Productivity organization, you'll
use your software design, analysis and programming skills to create innovative automated test systems.
This isn't a job in which you'll simply debug and run test cases; in fact that only scratches the surface. The
test team undertakes a broad range of challenges on a daily basis, designing and building intelligent
systems that can explore various use cases and scenarios for distributed computing infrastructure. Just
imagine trying to design and build an automated testing system for something that's never been done
before. There are no textbooks that can help you learn this, which is why we have some of the best and
brightest engineers working in this group.

The role:
Google's software engineers develop the next-generation technologies that change how millions of users
connect, explore, and interact with information and one another. Our ambitions reach far beyond just
Search. Our products need to handle information at the the scale of the web. We're looking for ideas from
every area of computer science, including information retrieval, artificial intelligence, natural language
processing, distributed computing, large-scale system design, networking, security, data compression,
and user interface design; the list goes on and is growing every day. As a software engineer, you work on
a small team and can switch teams and projects as our fast-paced business grows and evolves. We need
our engineers to be versatile and passionate to tackle new problems as we continue to push technology
forward. As a key member of a small and versatile team, you design, test, deploy and maintain software
solutions.

You will play a central role in the end-to-end development of entire new functionalities aimed at Android or iOS devices, working side-by-side with our backend and design specialists.

Speed and quality. You strive on proving that these are not mutually exclusive  that you can achieve both at the same time. You obsess about delivering business results as fast as possible.

You thrive in a startup culture where all hands are on deck, and consider no challenge too big or too small. 
A standout colleague. You believe that you can achieve more when you work in a team  that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. You rely on others candid feedback for continuous improvement. You want to work with different finance, mobile, product, design and fraud teams to build the best solution for Uber. 
Design and business insight. You understand requirements beyond the written word.

"Description 
 
If you want to use Artificial Intelligence to solve the most pressing problems in the Indian logistics industry, or optimize the distribution network of Indias largest third party logistics provider, our data team is the place to be. We are the countrys premium data science team featured widely in press and news; see Factordaily, LeMonde, Economic Times 1, Economic Times 2. 
 
The team comprises of leading experts in the field of Operations Research and Particle Physics, along with budding engineers and scientists in the field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
 
In the recent past, the data science team at Delhivery has built key capabilities in the following areas: 
  Maps:  
 Our business relies heavily on understanding where our end customers live and how to get there. This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/pincode data in smaller towns/villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc. 
  Machine Learning:  
 We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc. 
  Discrete Optimization:  
 We rely on a range of optimization methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc. 
 Simulation:  
 The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in-house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be self aware"". 
 We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in these areas. 
 
Responsibilities: 
  Contribute to the development/ deployment of machine learning algorithms, operational research, semantic analysis, and statistical methods for finding 
structure in large data sets  Use advanced statistics and machine learning on large scale multidimensional data and generate actionable insights that will be leveraged to drive operations and 
develop strategies for Delhivery.  Breakdown business problems by working closely with Product Team and Leadership Management Team, analyze requirements and look into data to 
recommend products and solutions  Optimize Delhivery operations by applying data science in solving complex business problems  Collaborate with cross-functional teams including but not limited to Logistics, BD, Sales, Marketing, Security, Customer Service, etc.  Disseminate original research in peer reviewed journals and conferences Qualifications 
 
A suitable candidate should satisfy as many of the following requirements: 
  B.Tech/PhD/M.Tech/M.S in Computer Science, Operational Research, Statistics, Applied Mathematics or Natural Sciences with a very clear understanding of probability and statistics, analytical approach to problem solving, and capability to think critically on a diverse array of problems.
