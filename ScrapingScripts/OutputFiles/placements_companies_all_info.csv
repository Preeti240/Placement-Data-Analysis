This is our story. Its a story that starts with a group of innovators. Back in 2013, the smartphone industry was stagnating. We imagined a better kind of smartphone and a better way of doing things. Our goal was to build a smartphone we would want to use ourselves. What started as a passion project soon turned into a global community. Fueled by a groundswell of support, we sought to redefine the way Android smartphones were built. 
This is who we are. We are a community looking to deliver true flagship experiences with smooth performance, quality software, and expert craftsmanship. We focus on the things that matter most to us - design and user experience. Most importantly, were not just doing it for ourselves. Our mission is to share the best technology, built hand-in-hand with you.

MishiPay is a mobile self checkout solution that brings the best of the online checkout experience to physical retail stores. 

Our technology allows in-store shoppers to pick up a product, scan the barcode and pay with their phone, and simply walk out of the shop with their purchase.The idea for MishiPay originated when Mustafa Khanwala, CEO and Founder, waited in a queue at a supermarket for 20 minutes to buy a single can of soda. Frustrated, he thought there must be a better way to do this, for both stores and their customers. And thus, the journey began.

Mercaris mission is to create value in a global marketplace where anyone can buy & sell. Today, we proudly count over 75 million downloads of the Mercari app worldwide, making us one of the most downloaded apps in Japan. We have always been committed to our goal of expanding overseas, and within a year and half of the Mercari app launch, we started our service in the US. With the recent release of the app in the UK, the majority of our product team is working on the global expansion of our service. Mercaris culture allows you to continually demonstrate a high level of professionalism, do everything possible to succeed, and to think and act boldly. Our core values are simple:  Go Bold: Aim for innovation and creative destruction that impacts the world.  All for One: As team, collectively and cooperatively work towards a unified goal.  Be Professional: Use your talent and expertise to the fullest potential; take ownership, and be willing to enhance your skills and abilities through work. We still have to increase our presence in each region, targeting not only North America and Europe, but countries in Asia and Africa as well. Once we have established ourselves in many regions, our next hurdle will be crossborder transactions. At that point, we will need to tackle global logistics and payments, as well as create our own automated translation system using natural language processing. We strive to bring our vision to reality. We are continuously looking for young talent to spearhead the development of our marketplace app and global expansion of our services. Mercari is seeking software engineers and changemakers to join the Tokyo headquarters. If youre looking for a job where you will be challenged, encouraged to revamp your skills with new technology, grow professionally, and collaborate with a team of extremely capable engineers, developers, and business managers: this job is for you.

Established in 1987 and headquartered in Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan, TSMC pioneered the pure-play foundry business model by focusing solely on manufacturing customers' products. By choosing not to design, manufacture or market any semiconductor products under its own name, the Company ensures that it never competes directly with its customers. Today, TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing 10,436 different products using 261 distinct technologies for 481 different customers in 2018.

With a large and diverse global customer base, TSMC manufactured semiconductors cover a wide range of applications in the computer, communications, consumer, industrial and standard segments and are used in a variety of end markets including mobile devices, high performance computing, automotive electronics and the Internet of Things (IoT). Strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which, in turn, helps the Company maintain higher levels of capacity utilization and profitability.

Annual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 12 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2018. These facilities include three 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab  all in Taiwan  as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.

TSMC provides customer service, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea. At the end of 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed more than 48,000 people.

■Overview
Making Reuse a common word to the world.
Our idea of Reuse is not that you sell your goods because you need cash, but our idea is to connect to someone who in-need of your most valued good. That way, you can invest something new that is truly important. When re-thinking about old Japanese culture that emphasize on passing goods from parents to children, then grandchildren, how about we now think of not only from insider of family, but passing the valued good to someone who really cherish it. This is basic idea of our business. We want more and more people to understand the value of reuse, and want people to make recycle a part of their lives. That way, someday the reuse would become a common concept. We are heading to a new challenge.

Chalo is a mobility start-up that aims to make travel better for everyone. With operations in 25+ cities and 250 million rides delivered each year, Chalo is solving a real-world problem that affects crores of Indians every day and creating Indias largest mobility company along the way.

How Large Is The Problem? 
Transport is the largest spend category for an average Indian household after food expenses, accounting for 20% of all expenses. Bus tickets account $60 billion annually, and are estimated to be 10x of taxis. However, each bus commuter spends the equivalent of 8 days a year waiting for a bus; and bus operators have losses running into hundreds of millions of dollars annually.

What does Chalo Solve?
Chalo is improving the city bus experience. With live bus tracking on the Chalo app, commuters have reduced their 30 minutes wait to just 2-3 minutes.Plus, with the Chalo Card and mobile tickets, they never have to worry about carrying change anymore, and can save money with each trip. This kick starts a virtuous circle, where happier commuters means more rides which in turn means more revenue for our bus operator partners, which leads to more investments in buses, and thus even better services for commuters.

How does Chalo Do It?
Chalo works in partnership with bus operators to deploy their proprietary technology stack and operations. By deploying an end-to-end solution from the hardware on the bus, to the software on the cloud, and mobile apps and cards for the commuter, Chalo is able to power a unique experience. 

Whats In Store for 2020? 
Chalo believes that buses run better on technology than on fuel. Chalo is all set to launch their service in some of Indias largest cities, and is working closely with city governments and bus operators to add more buses, especially electric buses. 

A Note from Chalo:
The benefits of providing a great mobility solution go beyond time and money. A bus can take 30 cars off the road, reduce millions of tonnes of emissions, improve safety, increase household savings and lead to a significant improvement in the quality of everyday life. The opportunity to build a company comes along rarely; the opportunity to build a company that can so dramatically impact the lives of millions, comes once in several lifetimes. If that opportunity does come knocking, you better be prepared to grab it with both hands and then give all of yourself to it. We will be frank, lots of things are work-in-progress at Chalo, but thats exactly why we are looking for individuals to take up challenging roles across the company to not just run, but solve, build and grow Chalo.

P.S. Were a super fun team to work with. We work hard and play harder!

FlyNava is a start-up building innovative airline solutions with presence in India,UAE,US & Europe. We take up tough and challenging legacy problems and have come up with Jupiter, our solution to the Airline Pricing Challenge, where airline industry experience, creativity and expert analytics have come together for building Jupiter. 
Jupiter empowers pricing analysts to enable fast decisions through one click actions based on insightful dashboards. So, what makes Jupiter so resourceful and how does it transform the pricing functions? 
We bring in data from nearly 30 sources (airlines own, market, global, social media) into a big database. Algorithms and analytics turn this big data into information, insight and predictions. Leveraging that, triggers for price action are generated in real time. The whole process can be achieved within minutes or in some cases can set up as auto pilot. 
With Jupiter's innovative KPIs, pricing analysts can effectively manage the performance of all pricing actions and the airlines can easily address the challenges of pricing by realizing high potential even during tough conditions.
