This is our story. Its a story that starts with a group of innovators. Back in 2013, the smartphone industry was stagnating. We imagined a better kind of smartphone and a better way of doing things. Our goal was to build a smartphone we would want to use ourselves. What started as a passion project soon turned into a global community. Fueled by a groundswell of support, we sought to redefine the way Android smartphones were built. 
This is who we are. We are a community looking to deliver true flagship experiences with smooth performance, quality software, and expert craftsmanship. We focus on the things that matter most to us - design and user experience. Most importantly, were not just doing it for ourselves. Our mission is to share the best technology, built hand-in-hand with you.

■Overview
Making Reuse a common word to the world.
Our idea of Reuse is not that you sell your goods because you need cash, but our idea is to connect to someone who in-need of your most valued good. That way, you can invest something new that is truly important. When re-thinking about old Japanese culture that emphasize on passing goods from parents to children, then grandchildren, how about we now think of not only from insider of family, but passing the valued good to someone who really cherish it. This is basic idea of our business. We want more and more people to understand the value of reuse, and want people to make recycle a part of their lives. That way, someday the reuse would become a common concept. We are heading to a new challenge.

■Type of Business
Sale and purchase of branded goods, precious metals, antique items. 
Develop related software products.
