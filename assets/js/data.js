Strong diversification helps to smooth fluctuations in demand, which, in turn, helps the Company maintain higher levels of capacity utilization and profitability.\n\nAnnual capacity of the manufacturing facilities managed by TSMC and its subsidiaries exceeded 12 million 12-inch equivalent wafers in 2018. These facilities include three 12-inch wafer GIGAFAB® fabs, four 8-inch wafer fabs, and one 6-inch wafer fab - all in Taiwan - as well as one 12-inch wafer fab at a wholly owned subsidiary, TSMC Nanjing Company Limited, and two 8-inch wafer fabs at wholly owned subsidiaries, WaferTech in the United States and TSMC China Company Limited.\n\nTSMC provides customer service, account management and engineering services through offices in North America, Europe, Japan, China, and South Korea. At the end of 2018, the Company and its subsidiaries employed more than 48,000 people.\n\nThe Company is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE) under ticker number 2330, and its American Depositary Shares (ADSs) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol TSM.","reference":"\nSelf\n","students":[{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"15EC32004","name":"DISHANK YADAV"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"15EC35024","name":"HARSHIT SHRIVASTAVA"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"15EC35030","name":"MEKALA SANDEEP"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"16EC10054","name":"SUBHRAJEET PANDA"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"16EE72P03","name":"SOURISH SARKAR"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"18CS60R34","name":"VAIBHAV MISHRA"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"18CS60R39","name":"STANCHION BISHOYI"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"18EE62R09","name":"GANATRA MAULIK ASHOKKUMAR"},{"company":"TSMC","jnf_ids":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"day":"Day-1","roll_no":"18EE64R04","name":"ARNAB SAHA"}],"country":"Taiwan","company":"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company","zipcode":300,"profiles":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12],"com_id":581,"website":"https://www.tsmc.com/english/default.htm","sector":"\nCore Engineering,Manufacturing\n","address":"8, Li-Hsin Rd. 6, Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu 300-78, Taiwan, R.O.C.","international":1,"employees":">5000","turnover":""},"70":{"category":"\nPrivate\n","city":"Hyderabad","about":"About Salesforce\nSalesforce, the Customer Success Platform and world's #1 CRM, empowers companies to connect with their customers in a whole new way.

This is a huge India specific challenge, primarily because of the unstandardized way of writing addresses and poor quality of road/pincode data in smaller towns/villages. We process a large amount of location data from our devices on the ground to learn locality boundaries, routes taken by ground staff, etc. \n • Machine Learning:  \n We use a range of machine learning techniques to automate decision making at the ground level, e.g., identifying whether a shipment is safe to fly based on its product description, identifying which shipments have a high probability of being returned, etc. \n • Discrete Optimization:  \n We rely on a range of optimization methods to ensure our distribution network is designed for cost efficiencies and scale, e.g., Vehicle Routing Problem to optimize the shipment collection process from clients, Facility Location Problem to ensure our distribution centres are suitably located, etc. \n• Simulation:  \n The scale of our distribution network often makes many problems intractable due to the existence of millions of variables and how they interact with each other over time. We are investing to build an in-house Simulator to enable us to measure the impact of changes in the network over time and ultimately design a system that can be 'self aware\". \n We are looking to expand our team to further our capabilities in these areas. \n \nResponsibilities: \n • Contribute to the development/ deployment of machine learning algorithms, operational research, semantic analysis, and statistical methods for finding \nstructure in large data sets • Use advanced statistics and machine learning on large scale multidimensional data and generate actionable insights that will be leveraged to drive operations and \ndevelop strategies for Delhivery. • Breakdown business problems by working closely with Product Team and Leadership Management Team, analyze requirements and look into data to \nrecommend products and solutions • Optimize Delhivery operations by applying data science in solving complex business problems • Collaborate with cross-functional teams including but not limited to Logistics, BD, Sales, Marketing, Security, Customer Service, etc. • Disseminate original research in peer reviewed journals and conferences Qualifications \n \nA suitable candidate should satisfy as many of the following requirements: \n • B.Tech/PhD/M.Tech/M.S in Computer Science, Operational Research, Statistics, Applied Mathematics or Natural Sciences with a very clear understanding of probability and statistics, analytical approach to problem solving, and capability to think critically on a diverse array of problems.

EagleView’s image superiority stemming from multi-modal capture from drones, low-flying aircraft and satellite, and patented capture technology, sets them apart from competitors. EagleView solutions are targeted to local government (property assessment, GIS, and public safety), construction (roofing), insurance (property claims and underwriting), and energy (solar, oil and gas, electric utilities) industries. \n\nEagleView is a fast-growing company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington with offices in Rochester, New York, and an international office in Perth, Australia. To support its growth strategy, EagleView recently opened its Engineering Center of Excellence (COE) in Bangalore, India - a world-class facility it intends to staff with leading software engineering talent. \n\nInteresting Company Facts\n\t•\tIn the U.S., EagleView has amassed the largest historical multi-modal image database of currency, resolution, and coverage with nearly a billion images covering 98% of the US population.\n•\tIn just the last 24 months, it has generated 50+ petabytes of imagery - roughly 300 million images.\n•\tEagleView flies over 9.5M linear miles each year to capture its imagery.\n•\tFor its various customers, it generates 20K+ reports per day.\n•\tIt’s transforming workflows performing 4.3M virtual inspections in 2018 diminishing companies’ reliance on high-carbon footprint physical inspections and lowering labor safety risks.\n•\tIt has 15 of the top 20 property and casualty insurance carriers as customers in the U.S.\n•\tIn government, its customers include 75% of the top U.S. local counties.\n•\tIts customers include 3 of the top solar energy companies including Tesla and Sunrun, and 10 of the top 30 utilities in the U.S.\n•\t150+ patents are held by EagleView relating to image capture, measurement methods, apps and platforms, and more…. the company literally invented the ability to use aerial imagery to measure property structures.\n\nProduct Portfolio Overview\t—\tImagery: Aerial imagery that displays orthogonal (top-down) and oblique (bird’s-eye view) perspectives. Advanced proprietary camera systems to generate ultra-high resolution imagery - imagery as fine as .075' GSD for orthogonal (top-down) and 1.0' GSD for oblique (angled) imagery.  \n—\tProperty data: Property data including attributes and measurements, derived from aerial imagery and other capture methods, that can be accessed by customers through APIs, or ordered online. EagleView also applies its Computer Vision to generate other insights including change detection. \n—\tWorkflow solutions: EagleView enables virtual inspections that digitize the workflow for both insurance carriers and their customers. Using a combination of imagery, Computer Vision, and virtual inspection solutions (drone led or \"boots-on-the ground\"), EagleView accelerates insurance claims processing.\nWhy We Win Business?\n\t•\tBest imagery in the market. With the most accurate, highest quality and largest historical multi-modal image database of currency, resolution, and coverage.\n•\tBest and most accurate information graph of properties, geometries, and structure attributes.  EagleView provides a historical property record and tracks attribute changes over time using state-of-the-art machine learning feature set extraction and automation.\n•\tAbility to scale. EagleView generates 20,000+ reports per day, and can scale to 40,000 per day.\n•\tReputation for innovation. EagleView invented the ability to derive structural measurements consistently and accurately from aerial imagery. It is modernizing workflows in Insurance, Construction, Government and Solar by revolutionizing what can be accomplished through virtual inspections using proprietary technology and processes.\n•\tCustomer advocacy and support. EagleView’s approach to customer support is legendary with its Government, Insurance and large and small Construction customers providing nimble customer support agents and Customer Success Managers who are focused on the ongoing delivery of workflows and imagery to ensure customer objectives are met.\n•\tImproving people’s lives. EagleView takes its role in the 'community' very seriously.  After 9/11, EagleView proactively flew its aircraft to capture imagery to enable the first responders to mobilize more effectively and safely. After major disasters, EagleView pilots and personnel are often the first to be deployed to assess damage to an area and work to quickly mitigate the situation for impacted citizens. \n\n€ƒ\n\nWhy EagleView?\tJoin a company that’s still small enough where you can have impact, yet big enough to support your career ambitions\n—\tWith a little over 700 full-time employees worldwide, EagleView is a relatively small company where you can make a difference and be very productive. While there's process, you can sidestep the bureaucracy of large multi-national tech companies. You can focus your energy on understanding the business and technology problems that need solving and move to execution rather seamlessly. That said, the company is mature enough to give you the opportunity to move into new lateral roles where you might want to learn new skills, or get promoted to increase your scope. You're not going to get stuck at a level because colleagues are \"resting and vesting\". You have mobility which is critical to career growth.\n—\tThe technology span of the business is broad giving you the opportunity to gain experience in various areas such as high resolution imagery generation, drone technology, mobile app development, SaaS, Big Data, Computer Vision and Machine Learning and eCommerce.\n—\tThe solution stack cuts across hardware, software and services giving you an opportunity to develop solutions across these elements - something that can't be said for a lot of technology companies that only focus on one of these areas. \n\nWork with smart and accomplished colleagues, and for a leadership that has a track record of success\n—\tWork with professionals who are the best in their field from leading tech companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and HP to break new ground in imagery capture, computer vision, and workflow transformation.\n\nGrow along with EagleView through a continued focus on innovation and a track record of investment\n•\tA timeline of IP investment and growth:\n2000: Established image capture technology\n2008: Pioneered trusted property measurement methods\n2015: Investment from Vista Equity Partners\n2017: Acquired OmniEarth (machine learning capabilities)\n2018: Investment from Clearlake Capital\n2018: Acquired Spookfish (image capture capabilities)\n2019: Leadership expansion and corporate rebrand\n•\tA differentiated patent portfolio spanning the following areas:\no\tStructure evaluation and measurement\no\tImage processing\no\tAerial camera systems\no\tMosaics\no\tMeasuring oblique imagery\n\n\n\to\tColor balancing in oblique imagery\no\tSystem for detecting image abnormalities\no\tUnmanned aerial vehicles\no\tModeling\no\tImage analysis\nWhy the EagleView Engineering Center of Excellence in Bangalore?\tBuild the next generation platform\n•\tThe EagleView Engineering Center of Excellence (COE) is building the next generation infrastructure that EagleView's business is based upon. It's mission-critical work. All cloud-based software development for the company will be built and driven out of India. \n•\tThe next generation platform you will be building will enable EagleView to collect more data in the next 18 months than in the company's 15-year history.\nHave a global impact while remaining in India\n•\tYou'll work with never seen amounts of geospatial data which will be used to solve important everyday problems. In the case of natural disasters or distress situations, you'll be helping to improve and potentially save lives from your seat oceans away. \nJoin a new entrant to India’s Silicon Valley\n•\tUnlike better known tech companies headquartered nearby, EagleView offers a startup culture where a lot still needs to be defined. EagleView will challenge you like a tech startup should and give growth opportunities not available in mature tech companies.\nEagleView Culture\tCulture\n•\tTrust & Candor: We build trust through constructive, candid communication that serves the common good.\n•\tAlignment & Accountability: We align around a decision and each contribute to and are accountable for its success.\n•\tRelentlessness & Humility: We are relentless in our pursuits of major victories and humble in our successes.\n\n\nJOB DESCRIPTION\n\nSoftware Engineer - I\n\nMixing technology, data, and first-in-class innovation, EagleView® is not only leading the property data analytics market, but also changing lives along the way.
